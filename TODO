Cleanup tasks:
x Don't filter the returned dicts in github.py
x Try to get rid of git.py -- it will make it easier to host this as a service.
- Move more processing out of JS and into Python
- Use Mocha for JS testing
- Move all the JS of pull_request.html into a JS file
- Change "user" to "owner" in github.py and in templates

User-facing:
x Add 'u' shortcut and link back to pull request view.
- Hide character-by-character diffs if they're too large? (mimc gerrit)
- When there's no diff, show "no diff", rather than the entire file on both sides.
- Redirect to OAuth flow whenever it's required, and redirect back to the right place.
- Return real error codes from XHR methods
- Render the Pull Request description with Markdown.
- Add support for "reply_to"-style comments.
- Classify comments as addressed/not addressed
- Add links to show more context
- Make text copy/pastable
- Add syntax highlighting
- Show diffstats on pull request view
- Support commenting on the left side of the diff (thread through /post_comment)
