Cleanup tasks:
- Move all the JS of pull_request.html into a JS file
- Use Mocha for JS testing
- Consolidate shared code between pull_request.html and file_diff.html
- Write some tests for the Python code
- Add a no-oauth mode
- Do github API requests in parallel

x Don't filter the returned dicts in github.py
x Try to get rid of git.py -- it will make it easier to host this as a service.
x Consolidate shared code between /pull and /diff handlers
x Consolidate draft / published comment transformation code.
x Change "user" to "owner" in github.py and in templates
x Move more processing out of JS and into Python (eliminate /diff XHR)

User-facing:
- Copy github URL pattern precisely (/:owner/:repo/pulls[/:number])
- Add support for "statuses" (e.g. Travis CI)
  "Waiting to hear about (commit)"
  "All is well"
- Embolden unreplied comment counts everywhere
- When there's no diff, show "no diff", rather than the entire file on both sides.
- Redirect to OAuth flow whenever it's required, and redirect back to the right place.
- Link to where diff comments were made on /pull page
- Return real error codes from XHR methods
- Make text copy/pastable
- Add syntax highlighting
- Show diffstats on pull request view
- Support commenting on the left side of the diff (thread through /post_comment)
- Copy github markdown CSS
- Auto-link "Pull Request...", "Issue...", etc.
- Make a better home page: show your open PRs, repos you're watching and their pull requests.

x Batch comments
x When you create a comment, the text field should auto-focus.
x Only show first line of commit message in commit list.
x Add a "publish" button which publishes all new comments.
x Add 'u' shortcut and link back to pull request view.
x Render the Pull Request description with Markdown.
x Add ability to write new top-level comments.
x Add a way to bust the github API cache
x Classify comments as addressed/not addressed
x Add a "Discard" button for draft comments
x Add support for "reply_to"-style comments.
x Hide character-by-character diffs if they're too large? (mimic gerrit)
x Make sha pair sticky on /pull pages
x Add links to show more context
