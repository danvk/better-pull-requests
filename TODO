Cleanup tasks:
- Don't filter the returned dicts in github.py
- Try to get rid of git.py -- it will make it easier to host this as a service.
- Move more processing out of JS and into Python
- Use Mocha for JS testing

User-facing:
- Hide character-by-character diffs if they're too large? (mimc gerrit)
