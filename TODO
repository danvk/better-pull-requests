Cleanup tasks:
- Move all the JS of pull_request.html into a JS file
- Use Mocha for JS testing
- Write some tests for the Python code
- Add a no-oauth mode
- Do github API requests in parallel

User-facing:
- Embolden unreplied comment counts everywhere
- When there's no diff, show "no diff", rather than the entire file on both sides.
- Return real error codes from XHR methods
- Make text copy/pastable
- Show diffstats on pull request view
- Support commenting on the left side of the diff (thread through /post_comment)
